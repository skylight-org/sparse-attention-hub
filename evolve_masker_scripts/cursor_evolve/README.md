# Cursor Evolve

This folder contains Cursor-driven experiments and utilities for evolving
maskers. Use the scripts here to iterate on experiment setups and analyze
results produced by the `cursor_evolve` workflows.

**Proposal** : Use Cursor, with its Agentic setup to evolve a piece of code.  

### how to run. 

Open the repository in cursor. An example task.mdc is provided in this folder. add it to the cursor chat. And ask it to perform the task. 


### starting point.

This code would evolve over 
```
sparse-attention-hub/sparse_attention_hub/sparse_attention/research_attention/maskers/evolve/evolve_masker.py
```
